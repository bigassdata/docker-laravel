# Docker Images for Laravel development
This repository provides you a development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. For this, it requires Docker and Docker Compose.


## Installation

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) ;

2. Copy `docker-compose.yml` file to your project root path, and edit it according to your needs ;

3. From your project directory, start up your application by running:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
4. If you want, you can run composer or artisan through docker. For instance:

```sh
docker-compose exec php composer install
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php $yourCommandHere
```


## Docker Images

These docker images are configured in `docker-compose.yml` file.
